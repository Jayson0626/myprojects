The love world is big, which can hold hundreds of disappointments;
the love world is small which is crowded even with three people inside.

To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world.

Don’t waste your time on a man/woman, who isn’t willing to waste their time on you.

Don’t try so hard, the best things come when you least expect them to.

Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one,
so that when we finally meet the person, we will know how to be grateful.

It is better bo have love and lost than never to have loved at all.

Love me little, love me long.

To live in a world without you is more painful than any punishment.
Do you know that no one can replace you in my heart?

If love is a mountain, then if men go up,
more women they will see while women will see fewer men.

Love makes man grow up or sink down.
